Centipede Game Outline

Player
    - moves up, down, left, right
    - can move anywhere
    - loses life
        - touches centipede
        - spider hits it
        - every life restarts game
    - moves through mushrooms
    - unlimited shots
    - player movement follows mouse movement
    - mouse clicks fire shots

Centipedes
    - starts at top right
    - moves horizontally
    - moves down a level and switches direction
        - if hits a mushroom
        - if hits a wall
    - centipede stops before player area moving back and forth
    - struck twice
        - section/segment of centipede will die
        - centipede will break into two parts (possibly in different directions)
    - if all parts of centipede die, new centipede will start at top
    - "Each segment of the centipede follows the segment in front
       of it, i.e., at each time t, a segment s following a segment
       s+1 will occupy the position that segment s+1 occupied at time t-1."

Mushroom
    - if hit 3 times by player, dies
    - nothing happens if hit by centipede
    - placing
        - place mushrooms from top to bottom
        - likelihood
            - intake from file or input a percent
            - two ways
                - get number and multiply it by number of spaces, then input into random number generator, put mushrooms in corresponding places
                - for each place generate random number (1-100), if above input: keep
        - locations by random #, leave if doesn't block off above mushrooms
        - not along a wall
    - if player dies, mushrooms hit <3 times are fully restored

Spider
    - moves erratically
    - dies if shot 2 times by player
    - new player life also generates new spider life
